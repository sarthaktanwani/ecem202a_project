# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective
 
What are you trying to do and why? (plain English without jargon)
We are trying to study the distribution of control in a non-adversarial networked control system with respect to network dynamics. In other words, we are studying the different cases of distribution of control between robots wirelessly and how does the network behave and its parameters in these cases.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations
 
How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
1. Absence of simulators that can simulate both a physics based robotics environment as well as wireless network between robots that can properly simulate real-world scenarios without taking ideal assumptions
2. Most of the literature on distribution of control between robots is between an autonomous robot and a human. However, we are studying the distribution of control between a mobile autonomous robot and a static autonomous robot

## 3. Novelty & Rationale
  
What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
It will be successful because it allows for a more intimate cotrol of the mobile autonomous robot without compromising on the security and privacy of the building infrastructure(in our case). Our approach clearly marks the distinction between how much information the autonomous mobile robot needs and gets in order to navigate inside a building. We have created 3 different cases with varying levels of control distribution between the mobile robot and the building and we will study the network parameters in each case. The network parameters would play an important role in outlining what level of control a robot needs in each case vs the load on the network. This could, in the future, be used to make design choices like what network technology to use, what is the average power consumption... etc

## 4. Potential Impact

If the project is successful
If the project is successful, what difference will it make, both technically and broadly?

## 5. Challenges

1. The main challenge is the lack of proper support on a software that can simulate a physics based robotics environment and the wireless network between robots.
What are the challenges and risks?

## 6. Requirements for Success

What skills and resources are necessary to perform the project?
